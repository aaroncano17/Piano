# Simple Electronic Piano

This project is a basic electronic piano built with an Arduino, piezo buzzer, and push buttons. Each button produces a different musical note. Inspired by [this Instructables guide](https://www.instructables.com/Simple-Electronic-Piano/).

## Materials

- Arduino Uno or similar
- Piezo buzzer
- Push buttons (one per note, e.g., 7 for a C-major scale)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram

Connect each button to a digital input pin and to ground. The piezo buzzer connects to a digital output pin. See the original [Instructables schematic](https://www.instructables.com/Simple-Electronic-Piano/) for wiring details.

## Instructions

1. Assemble the circuit on a breadboard as per the diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino code to your board.
3. Press buttons to play different notes.

## Arduino Code

See [`piano.ino`](piano.ino).
